    <h2>How to reduce the pollution caused by the crackers?</h2>
    <p> It is simple, don't use firecrackers. But it is harder than it sounds. There are more than 7.5 billion people on
        our mother Earth. Now to get this message and force them may be next to impossible. So, we can at least stop with 
        the diwali bombs as <b>Diwali is not about bombs</b>.

    <h2>Why I made this web page?</h2>
    <p> I have no project relating this still I spent 6-7 hrs on making this. <b>WHY??</b> Well, I saw all these bombs
        just explode just making noise and one of my friends gave it to me. I lit it up. It exploded immediatly. The next
        thing I hear is my ears ringing, completely deaf. That is what gave me the motivation to make this web page.
