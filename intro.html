            Diwali is indeed a very fun festival with lanterns, diyas and crackers. But there is one
            problem, these crackers are literal mini grenades!! Well some of them even triggered some random
            car's alarm!!! I mean I don't deny that it is fun bursting crackers but the ones that give out light
            and positive energy, not the ones that simply burst and emmit carbon everywhere. So, this will be an 
            awareness website depicting the <a href="harm.html">harmful effects of crackers.</a>
