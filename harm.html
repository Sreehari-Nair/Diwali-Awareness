           Crackers are indeed harmful to the environment. But you know bursting crackers is
           fun. So, why don't minimise the pollution? Here, we will talk about the harmful effects
           it causes to the environment. Accidentally clicked here? Feel free to go <a href="intro.html">Back</a>.

    <center><h2>1. Noise pollution</h2></center> 
    <p>
       Crackers are crackers because of one of its uniqueness. It is the noise that they emmit. Especially
       the diwali bombs. They are only known for the noise they emmit. Though noise pollution is not very 
       famouse like air or water pollution but play a major role like them.
       Noise pollution impacts millions of people on a daily basis. The most common health problem it 
       causes is Noise Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL). Exposure to loud noise can also cause high blood pressure,
       heart disease, sleep disturbances, and stress. These health problems can affect all age groups, especially children.
       So, I think we are good to say lesser bombs. Wanna know more or don't believe me? Then visit the

       Light shows also one of the specialities crackers are bought for. Those beautiful light displayes are
       not something to be ignored I mean look at this beauty of an image!! Doesn't it awe you? But again what is
       light pollution? Light pollution is when there is more light in a particular place than the amount of light there 
       should be. I know, sounds strange, but is definetly true. This occurs at especially night during diwali and nearly
       everyday. Too much light pollution washes out the view of the Universe, increasing energy consumption, 
       interferes with astronomical research, disrupts ecosystems, and affects the health and safety of humans and wildlife.
       ... For example, all the lights of a city change the way light and dark fall. Rest of the story is way too advanced for
       atleast me. More information is
       <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/article/light-pollution/" target="blank">Here</a>.

    <center><h2>3. Air pollution</h2></center>
    <p>
        Now, last but not least air pollution. It is not new to us, my whole school is about go green. So, it isn't new to us
        that crackers do emmit carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide and us Indians bursting thousands a day change the air 
        composition a lot for a few days decreasing the amount of oxygen significantly. Now, we all know we need O<sub>2</sub> 
        to live. But in case you are living under a rock let me explain.Long-term health effects from air pollution 
        include heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases such as emphysema. Air pollution can also cause long-term 
        damage to people's nerves, brain, kidneys, liver, and other organs. Some scientists suspect air pollutants cause birth defects.
        So yeah... air pollution = bad. Wanna know more? Click

        Now in the extreme light part I wrote it distrupts ecosystems and puts animals in danger not just our
        street dogs and cats but <b>Pets</b> as well. The extreme amount of light effects their sensitive eyes but the more
        dangerous,a whole lot of noise may force them to run out of their homes, <b>DOGS BREAK CHAINS</b> and whatnot
        does that convince you to stop bombarding your neighborhood?
